## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added quotes to the "Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION" to avoid the note.

* Added dontrun around the examples of "HULL()" as they sometimes needed over 2.5 seconds of runtime.

## Test environments
* local OS X R installation (Mojave 10.14.6), R 4.0.2
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.0
* win-builder (release and devel)
* Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 (r-hub), R-devel, 32/64 bit

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
