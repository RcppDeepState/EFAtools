## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version we have:

* Added quotes to API and package names in the Title and Description fields of DESCRIPTION.

* Replaced \dontrun{} with \donttest{}, except for two examples in HULL and PARALLEL, where parallel processing is used and would result in errors if tested.

* Explicitly added authors on whose code some of ours is based/ that inspired some of our code as contributors ("ctb") in the DESCRIPTION instead of just citing them in the respective help files.

## Test environments
* local OS X R installation (Mojave 10.14.6), R 4.0.2
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.0
* win-builder (release and devel)
* Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 (r-hub), R-devel, 32/64 bit

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
