\description{
This function implements the Schmid-Leiman (SL) transformation. It takes the
pattern coefficients and factor intercorrelations from an oblique factor solution as
input and can reproduce the results from \code{\link[psych:schmid]{psych::schmid}},
from the SPSS implementation from Wolff & Preising (2005), and from MacOrtho
(Watkins, 2004). To reproduce psych or SPSS, only the type and method arguments have to be
specified additional to the loadings and factor intercorrelations. Other
arguments from \code{\link{EFA}} can be used to control the procedure to find
the second order loadings more flexibly.

\details{
The SL transformation (also called SL orthogonalization) is a procedure with
which an oblique factor solution is transformed into a hierarchical,
orthogonalized solution. As a first step, the factor intercorrelations are
again factor analyzed to find second-order factor loadings. If there is only
one higher-order factor, this step of the procedure stops there, resulting in
a second-order factor structure. The first-order factor and the second-order
factor are then orthogonalized, resulting in an orthogonalized factor solution
with proportionaliy constraints. The procedure thus makes a suggested
hierarchical data structure based on factor intercorrelations explicit. One
major advantage of SL transformation is that it enables variance
partitioning between higher-order and first-order factors, including the
calculation of Omega (see \code{\link{OMEGA}}).
