\title{Schmid-Leiman Transformation}
\usage{
SL(x, Phi = NULL, type = "SG", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object of class \code{\link{PROMAX}} or class \code{\link{fa}} or
matrix. If class \code{\link{PROMAX}} or class \code{\link{fa}},
pattern coefficients and factor intercorrelations are taken from this object.
x can also be a pattern matrix from an oblique factor solution (see \code{Phi}).}

\item{Phi}{matrix. A matrix of factor intercorrelations from an oblique factor
solution. Only needs to be specified if x is not of class \code{\link{PROMAX}}
or class \code{\link{fa}}.}

\item{type}{character. One of "SG" (default), "psych", or "SPSS". This
is used to control the procedure of the second order factor analysis. See
\code{\link{PAF}} for details.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to \code{PAF}.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following
\item{sl}{A matrix with g loadings, group factor loadings, communalities,
and uniquenesses.}
\item{L2}{Second-order factor loadings.}
\item{vars_accounted}{Matrix of explained variances and sums of squared loadings}
}
\description{
This function implements the Schmid-Leiman (SL) transformation. It takes the
 pattern
coefficients and factor intercorrelations from an oblique factor solution as
input and can reproduce the results from \code{\link[psych:schmid]{psych::schmid}},
from the SPSS
implementation from Wolff & Preising (2005), and from MacOrtho (Watkins, 2004).
To reproduce
psych or SPSS, only the type argument has to be specified additional to the
loadings and factor intercorrelations. Other arguments from \code{\link{PAF}} can
be used to control the procedure to find the second order loadings more
flexibly.

\details{
The SL transformation (also called SL orthogonalization) is a procedure with
which an oblique factor solution is transformed into a hierarchical,
orthogonalized solution. As a first step, the factor intercorrelations are
again factor analyzed to find second-order factor loadings. If there is only
one higher-order factor, this step of the procedure stops there, resulting in
a second-order factor structure. The first-order factor and the second-order
factor are then orthogonalized, resulting in an orthogonalized factor solution
with proportionaliy constraints. The procedure thus makes a suggested
hierarchical data structure based on factor intercorrelations explicit. One
major advantage of SL transformation is that it enables variance
partitioning between higher-order and first-order factors, including the
calculation of Omega (see \code{\link{OMEGA}}).
