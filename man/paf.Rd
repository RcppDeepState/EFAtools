\usage{
paf(x, n_factors, cors = TRUE, max_iter = 300, init_comm = "smc",
  criterion = 1e-05, criterion_type = "max_individual",
  paf_type = "norm", signed_loadings = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{dataframe of raw data or matrix with correlations.}

\item{n_factors}{numeric. Number of factors to extract.}

\item{cors}{logical. If TRUE (default) a correlation matrix is expected in x, otherwise raw data is expected.}

\item{max_iter}{numeric. The maximum number of iterations (default is 300) to perform after which the iterative PAF procedure is halted with a warning.}

\item{init_comm}{string. The method to estimate the initial communalities. "smc" (default) will use squared multiple correlations. "mac" will use maximum absolute correlations. "unity" will use 1s.}

\item{criterion}{numeric. The convergence criterion (default is .00001). If the change in communalities from one iteration to the next is smaller than this criterion the solution is accepted and the procedure ends. Details depend on criterion_type.}

\item{criterion_type}{string. "max_individual" (default) selects the maximum change in any of the communalities from one iteration to the next and tests it against the specified criterion. This is also used by SPSS. "sums" takes difference of the sum of all communalities in one iteration and the sum of all communalities in the next iteration and tests it against the criterion. This procedure is used by the psych fa() function.}

\item{paf_type}{string. Which algorithm to use in the PAF iterations. If "norm" (default), the loadings are computed from the eigenvalues. This is also used by the psych fa() function. If "SPSS" the loadings are computed with the absolute eigenvalues as done by SPSS.}

\item{signed_loadings}{logical. If TRUE (default), the sign of factors with negative sum of loadings is reflected. This is done by both SPSS and psych::fa().}
}
\value{
A list containing the following

\item{h2_init}{Initial communality estimates.}
\item{iter}{The number of iterations needed for convergence.}
\item{orig_eigen}{Eigen values of the original correlation matrix.}
\item{init_eigen}{Initial eigenvalues, obtained from the correlation matrix with the initial communality estimates as diagonal.}
\item{final_eigen}{Eigenvalues of the final iteration.}
\item{loadings}{Loading matrix containing the final loadings.}
