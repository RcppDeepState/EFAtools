\arguments{
\item{x}{matrix or data.frame. The real data to compare the simulated eigenvalues
against. Must not contain variables of classes other than numeric. Can be a
correlation matrix or raw data.}

\item{cors}{logical. Whether x is a correlation matrix (TRUE), or raw data.
against. Must not contain variables of classes other than numeric.}

\item{n_cases}{numeric. The number of cases / observations to simulate. Should only
be specified if \code{x} is left as \code{NULL} as otherwise the dimensions are taken from \code{x}.}

\item{n_vars}{numeric. The number of variables / indicators to simulate. Should only
be specified if \code{x} is left as \code{NULL} as otherwise the dimensions are taken from \code{x}.}

\item{n_datasets}{numeric. The number of datasets to simulate. Default is 1000.}

\item{percent}{numeric. A vector of percentiles to take the simulated eigenvalues from.
Default is 95.}

\item{eigen_type}{character. On what the eigenvalues should be found. Can be
either "PAF", "PCA", or "FA". If using "PAF", the diagonal of the correlation
matrices is replaced by the squared multiple correlations (SMCs) of the
indicators. If using "PCA", the diagonal values of the correlation matrices
are left to be 1. If using "FA", eigenvalues are found on the correlation
matrices with the final communalities of a 1 factor principal axis factoring
solution as diagonal.}

\item{data_type}{character. Currently only "sim" is implemented. Finds eigenvalues
for parallel analysis on simulated data.}

\item{replace}{logical. Currently ignored. Whether, if \code{data_type = "resample"}, the
resampling should be done with replacements or not. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{na_action}{character. What to do with \code{NA}s occurring in \code{x}. \code{"rm"}
removes them list-wise. \code{"none"} returns a warning if \code{NA}s occur and
in this case does not perform resampling, nor compares the the eigen values
of \code{x} against the simulated ones.}

\item{decision_rule}{character. Which rule to use to determine the number of
factors to retain. Default is \code{"mean"}, which will use the average
simulated eigenvalues. \code{"Percentile"}, uses the percentiles specified
in percent. \code{"Crawford"} uses the 95th percentile for the first factor
and the mean afterwards (based on Crawford et al, 2010).}

\item{criterion}{numeric. The convergence criterion.
If the change in communalities from one iteration to the next is smaller than
this criterion the solution is accepted and the procedure ends. Details
depend on criterion_type. Default is \code{.001}.}

\item{criterion_type}{character. "max_individual" selects the
maximum change in any of the communalities from one iteration to the next
and tests it against the specified criterion. This is also used by SPSS.
"sums" takes difference of the sum of all communalities in one iteration and
the sum of all communalities in the next iteration and tests it against the
criterion. This procedure is used by the \code{\link[psych:fa]{psych::fa}} function.
Default is \code{"sums"}.}

\item{max_iter}{numeric. The maximum number of iterations to
perform after which the iterative PAF procedure is halted with a warning.
Default is \code{1000}.}
}
\value{
A list of class PARALLEL containing the following objects
\item{eigenvalues}{A matrix containing the eigenvalues of the real and the simulated data.}
\item{n_factors}{The number of factors to retain according to the parallel procedure.}
\item{ctrl}{A list of control settings used in the print function.}
}
\description{
Various methods for performing parallel analysis. This function uses
\link{future.apply}{future_lapply} for which a parallel processing plan can
be selected. To do so, call \code{library(future)} and, for example,
 \code{plan(multisession)}; see examples.
