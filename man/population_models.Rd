\format{A list of 2 lists "loadings" and "phis".
\describe{
\code{loadings} contains the following matrices:
  \item{baseline}{(matrix) - The loadings of the baseline model. Three factors with six indicators each, all with loadings of .6. Same baseline model as used in de Winter and Dodou (2012).}
  \item{case_1a}{(matrix) - Small number of indicators per factor, in this case 2.}
  \item{case_1b}{(matrix) - Small number of indicators per factor, in this case 3. Case 5 in de Winter and Dodou (2012).}

  \item{case_4}{(matrix) - Different loadings between factors (one factor with .9, .6, and .3, respectively). Case 7 in de Winter and Dodou (2012).}
  \item{case_5}{(matrix) - Different loadings within factors (each factor has two loadings of each .9, .6, and .3). Similar to cases 8/ 9 in de Winter and Dodou (2012).}
  \item{case_6a}{(matrix) - 1 crossloading of .4. Similar to case 10 in de Winter and Dodou (2012).}

\description{
Pupulation factor models used for the model recovery analyses reported in
Grieder and Steiner (2019). All combinations of the loadings and the factor
intercorrelations were used in the simulations. Many models are based on cases
used in de Winter and Dodou (2012).
