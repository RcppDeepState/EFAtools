\title{EFAtools: Fast and flexible implementations of exploratory factor analysis tools}
\description{
The EFAtools package provides functions to perform exploratory factor analysis (EFA) procedures and compare their solutions. The goal is to provide state-of-the-art factor retention methods and a high degree of flexibility in the EFA procedures. This way, implementations from R psych and SPSS can be compared. Moreover, functions for Schmid-Leiman transformation, and computation of omegas are provided. To speed up the analyses, some of the iterative procedures like principal axis factoring (PAF) are implementded in C++.
