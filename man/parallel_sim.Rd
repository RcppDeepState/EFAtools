\usage{
parallel_sim(ndatasets, nvars, ncases, kind)
}
\arguments{
\item{ndatasets}{numeric. Number of datasets with dimensions (ncases, nvars) to simulate.}

\item{nvars}{numeric. Number of variables / indicators in dataset.}

\item{ncases}{numeric. Number of cases / observations in dataset.}

\item{kind}{numeric. Whether PCA (kind = 1; i.e., leaving diagonal of correlation matrix at 1) or PAF (kind = 2; i.e., setting diagonal of correlation matrix to SMCs).}

\description{
Function called from within PARALLEL so usually no call to this is needed by the user.
Provides a C++ implementation of the PARALLEL simulation procedure
