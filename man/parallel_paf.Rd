\title{Principal Axis Factoring to extract eigenvalues from a 1 factor solution}
\usage{
parallel_paf(R, criterion, crit_type, max_iter)
}
\arguments{
\item{R}{numeric matrix. Correlation matrix to perform PAF with 1 factor solution on.}

\item{criterion}{double. Convergence criterion to use.}

\item{crit_type}{integer. Whether max_individual (1) or sums (2).}

\item{max_iter}{integer. The maximum number of iterations after which to stop the iterative procedure if no convergence is reached by then.}
}
\description{
Function called from within PARALLEL so usually no call to this is needed by the user.
Provides a C++ implementation of 1 factor PAF. Returns the eigenvalues obtained
from the correlation matrix with the final communality estimates as diagonal of
R.
