\title{Compare loadings or communalities of different implementations}
\usage{
compare(x, y, reorder = TRUE, print_digits = 4, m_red = 0.001,
  range_red = 0.001, round_red = 3, print_diff = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{matrix, dataframe, or vector. Loadings or communalities of one
implementation.}

\item{y}{matrix, dataframe, or vector. Loadings or communalities of another
implementation to compare to x.}

\item{reorder}{logical. Whether factors should be reordered according to their
colnames.}

\item{print_digits}{numeric. Number of decimals to print in the output
(default is 4).}

\item{m_red}{numeric. Number above which the mean and median should be printed
in red (i.e., if .001 is used, the mean will be in red if it is larger than
.001, otherwise it will be displayed in green. Default is .001).}

\item{range_red}{numeric. Number above which the min and max should be printed
in red (i.e., if .001 is used, min and max will be in red if the max is larger
 than .001, otherwise it will be displayed in green. Default is .001). Note that
 the color of min also depends on max.}

\item{round_red}{numeric. Number above which the max decimals to round to where
all corresponding elements of x and y are still equal are displayed in red
(i.e., if 3 is used, the number will be in red if it is smaller than
 3, otherwise it will be displayed in green. Default is 3).}

\item{print_diff}{logical. Whether the difference vector or matrix should be
printed or not (default is TRUE).}
}
\value{
Print out a comparison summary.
}
\description{
The functions takes two objects of the same dimensions containing numeric
information (loadings or communalities) and prints the following summary
information of the absolute difference of the objects: mean, median, min, max,
number above which the max decimals to round to where
all corresponding elements of x and y are still equal are displayed, and the
difference object itself.
