\arguments{
\item{x}{data.frame or matrix. Dataframe or matrix of raw data or matrix with
correlations. If "CD" is included as a criterion, \code(x) must be raw data.}

\item{criteria}{character. A vector with the factor retention methods to
perform. Possible inputs are: "CD", "EKC", "HULL", "KGC", "PARALLEL",
and "SMT" (see details). By default, all factor retention methods are
performed.}

\item{suitability}{logical. Whether the data should be checked for suitability
for factor analysis using the Kaiser-Guttmann criterion and Bartlett's test
of sphericity (see details). Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{N}{numeric. The number of observations. Only needed if x is a
correlation matrix.}

\item{use}{character. Passed to \code{\link[stats:cor]{stats::cor}} if raw
data is given as input. Default is "pairwise.complete.obs".}

\item{n_factors_max}{numeric. Passed to \code{\link{CD}}.The maximum number
of factors to test against.
Larger numbers will increase the duration the procedure takes, but test more
possible solutions. Maximum possible is number of variables / 2. Default is
NA. If not specified, number of variables / 2 is used.}

\item{N_pop}{numeric. Passed to \code{\link{CD}}. Size of finite populations
of comparison data. Default is 10000.}

\item{N_samples}{numeric. Passed to \code{\link{CD}}. Number of samples drawn
from each population. Default is 500.}

\item{alpha}{numeric. Passed to \code{\link{CD}}. The alpha level used to test
the significance of the improvement added by an additional factor.
Default is .30.}

\item{cor_method}{character. Passed to \code{\link[stats:cor]{stats::cor}}
Default is "pearson".}

\item{max_iter_CD}{numeric. Passed to \code{\link{CD}}. The maximum number of
iterations to perform after which the iterative PAF procedure is halted.
 Default is 50.}

\description{
Among the most important decisions in exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is
the choice of the number of factors to retain. Several factor retention
criteria have been developed for this. With this function, various factor
 retention criteria can be performed simultaneously. Additionally, the data
 can be checked for their suitability for factor analysis.

\examples{
# All criteria, with correlation matrix and fit method "ML" (where needed)
# This will throw a warning for CD, as no raw data were specified
