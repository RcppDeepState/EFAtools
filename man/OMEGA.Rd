\arguments{
\item{model}{class \code{\link{SL}}, class \code{\link{schmid}}, or class
\code{\link{lavaan}} object. That is, an output object from \code{\link{SL}}, from
\code{\link[psych:schmid]{psych::schmid}}, or from a \code{\link{lavaan}}
bifactor model. If of class \code{\link{lavaan}}, no other arguments need to
be specified. If of class \code{\link{SL}} or \code{\link{schmid}}, only
the arguments \code{factor_corres} and \code{cormat} need to be specified
additionally.}

\item{var_names}{numeric. A vector with subtest names in the order
of the rows from the SL solution. This needs only be specified if \code{model}
is left \code{NULL}}

\item{fac_names}{character. An optional vector of group factor names in the
order of the columns of the SL solution.}

\item{factor_corres}{numeric. A vector that indicates which variable corresponds
to which group factor. Must be in the same order as the SL solution. For example
c(3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2) if the first three variables load on the third group
factor of the SL solution, the next two on the first group factor and the
last two on the second group factor. If a variable should not be assigned to
any group factor, insert a zero at its position (e.g. c(3, 3, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2),
the third variable has no corresponding group factor).}

\item{g_load}{numeric. A vector of general factor loadings from an SL solution.
This needs only be specified if \code{model} is left \code{NULL}.}

\item{s_load}{matrix. A matrix of group factor loadings from an SL solution. This needs
only be specified if \code{model} is left \code{NULL}}

\item{u2}{numeric. A vector of uniquenesses from an SL solution. This needs
only be specified if \code{model} is left \code{NULL} and \code{type} is
not \code{Watkins}.}

\item{Phi}{matrix. Factor intercorrelations from an oblique factor solution.}

\item{pattern}{matrix. Pattern coefficients from an oblique factor solution.}

\item{cormat}{matrix. A correlation matrix to be used when \code{type = "psych"} or
\code{type = "EFAtools"}. If left \code{NULL}, the correlation matrix is found based on the
pattern matrix and Phi using \code{\link[psych:factor.model]{psych::factor.model}}.
If the correlation matrix is available, \code{cormat} should be specified instead
of \code{Phi} and \code{pattern}.}

\item{variance}{character. If \code{"correlation"}, then total variances for the whole
scale as well as for the subscale composites are calculated based on the correlation
matrix. If \code{"sums_load"}, then total variances are calculated using the
squared sums of general factor loadings and group factor loadings and
the sum of uniquenesses (see details).}
}
\value{
A matrix with omegas for the whole scale and for the subscales.
\item{tot}{Omega total.}
\item{hier}{Omega hierarchical.}
\item{sub}{Omega subscale.}
}
\description{
This function finds omega total, omega hierarchical, and omega subscale
from a Schmid-Leiman (SL) solution or lavaan bifactor solution. The SL-based
omegas can either be found using the outputs from
\code{\link[psych:schmid]{psych::schmid}} or from \code{\link{SL}}, or, in a
more flexible way, by leaving \code{model = NULL} and specifying additional arguments.
By setting the \code{type} argument, results from
\code{\link[psych:omega]{psych::omega}}
or Watkins' omega program (Watkins, 2013) can be reproduced.
}
\section{How to combine arguments}{


If \code{model} is specified and of class \code{\link{lavaan}},
no other arguments need to be specified.
If \code{model} is of class
\code{\link{SL}} or \code{\link{schmid}}, only the argument \code{factor_corres}
needs to be specified additionally. There is, however, the option to reproduce
Watkins' Omega or \code{\link[psych:omega]{psych::omega}} results by setting the
\code{type} argument to \code{"Watkins"} or \code{"psych"}.
If \code{model = NULL} and \code{type = "EFAtools"}(default), the arguments
\code{var_names}, \code{factor_corres}, \code{g_load}, \code{s_load}, and \code{u2}
need to be specified.
If \code{type = "psych"} or \code{type = "EFAtools"}, either \code{cormat}
(recommended) or \code{Phi} and \code{pattern} must be specified.
Additionally, the argument \code{factor_corres} should be left NULL to
replicate \code{\link[psych:omega]{psych::omega}}
results, where variable-to-factor correspondences are found by taking the highest
group factor loading for each variable as the relevant group factor loading.
If \code{type = "Watkins"}, the \code{u2} argument
should be left \code{NULL} to replicate results from Watkins' Omega program, where
uniquenesses are found based on the general factor loadings and relevant group factor
loadings only. If, however, the argument \code{u2} is specified, the specified
uniquenesses are taken, with a warning.
}

\section{Calculation of omega for different types}{


The main differences between the types concern the calculation of the total
variance (for the whole scale as well as the subscale composites) as well as
the finding of variable-to-factor correspondences. The former aspect
can also be controlled individually by specifying the variance argument, the
latter by specifying the factor_corres argument.
For \code{type = "EFAtools"}, total variances are found using the correlation
matrix, and variable-to-factor correspondences have to be specified manually.
The only difference for \code{type = "psych"} is that it takes the highest
group factor loading for each variable as the relevant group factor loading.
To mimik results from Watkins' Omega program, for \code{type = "Watkins"}
for each variable only the general factor loading and the relevant group-factor
loadings according to the specified variable-to-factor correspondences is
taken into account. The other loadings are set to zero. Uniquenesses are found
based on these two loadings per variable only and total variance is calculated
based on all using the squared sums of general loadings and group factor loadings
and the sum of these uniquenesses.
