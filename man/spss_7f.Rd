  \item{final_communalities}{(vector) - The final communalities obtained with the FACTOR algorithm with PAF and no rotation. For details see Grieder and Grob (2019).}
  \item{final_eigenvalues}{(vector) - Final eigenvalues obtained with the FACTOR algorithm with PAF and no rotation.}
  \item{loadings_unrotated}{(matrix) - F1 to F7 = unrotated factor loadings obtained with the FACTOR algorithm with PAF. Rownames are the abbreviated subtest names. For details see Grieder and Grob (2019).}
  \item{paf_iter}{(numeric) - Number of iterations needed for the principal axis factoring to converge.}
  \item{loadings_varimax}{(matrix) - F1 to F7 = varimax rotated factor loadings obtained with the FACTOR algorithm with PAF. Rownames are the abbreviated subtest names. For details see Grieder and Grob (2019).}
  \item{loadings_promax}{(matrix) - F1 to F7 = promax rotated factor loadings obtained with the FACTOR algorithm with PAF. Rownames are the abbreviated subtest names. For details see Grieder and Grob (2019).}
  \item{structure_promax}{(matrix) - F1 to F7 = promax rotated factor loadings obtained with the FACTOR algorithm with PAF. Rownames are the abbreviated subtest names. For details see Grieder and Grob (2019).}
  \item{phi_promax}{(matrix) - F1 to F7 = intercorrelations of the promax rotated loadings.}
