  \item{final_communalities}{(data.frame) - Subtest = abbreviated subtest names. For details see Grieder and Grob (2019). FACTOR = the final communalities obtained with the FACTOR algorithm with PAF and no rotation.}
  \item{final_eigenvalues}{(data.frame) - Factor = the factors from 1 to n factors. eigen = final eigenvalues obtained with the FACTOR algorithm with PAF and no rotation.}
  \item{loadings_unrotated}{(data.frame) - subtest = the abbreviated subtest names. For details see Grieder and Grob (2019). F1 to Fn (where n = number of factors) = unrotated factor loadings obtained with the FACTOR algorithm with PAF}
  \item{loadings_varimax}{(data.frame) - subtest = the abbreviated subtest names. For details see Grieder and Grob (2019). F1 to Fn (where n = number of factors) = varimax rotated factor loadings obtained with the FACTOR algorithm with PAF}
  \item{loadings_promax}{(data.frame) - subtest = the abbreviated subtest names. For details see Grieder and Grob (2019). F1 to Fn (where n = number of factors) = promax rotated factor loadings obtained with the FACTOR algorithm with PAF}
